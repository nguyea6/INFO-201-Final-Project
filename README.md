 This project presents data about bicycle and pedestrian traffic around Seattle in the form of an interactive data report, and how that traffic may be affected by various factors such as location, date, and weather, created as a term project for the [Technical Foundations](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1128814) course at the UW iSchool.
